This is both a plus and a minus.  Also, with limited bandwidth for voters regarding local politics, people rely on endorsements from party and organizations.  In my community, we have a ""political machine"" that openly manipulates these endorsing organizations through tactics up to and including intimidation.  all three of the most important endorsing organizations were brazenly manipulated by my opponent, an incumbent, who also used public funds to support his campaign AND ran a relentlessly negative race.  I still got 46-48% of the votes (ran twice against hime).  Clearly, without those manipulations he would have lost.  So - it's pretty ugly even in relatively small communities.  He also got $30,000 in PAC money spent in his support - from real restate interests.  My local firefighters endorsed me and spent some money, about $4,000-$5,000 in support of my candidacy.  THe $30,000 spent on my opponent by the real estate PAC was from no-where in our region.  A typical race for city council in my community costs from $20-40,000, so a $30,000 boost almost doubles what was spent.  Bottom line - PAC money is coming into small, ""easy to buy"" races at very low level, with big influence.  In a town with no ""real"" press (won't do any investigative journalism or critique voting crowd), where endorsing organizations are relatively easy for those in power to manipulate, it's hard for even a very popular candidate like myself to win.",52
